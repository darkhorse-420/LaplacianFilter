Laplacian Filtering in Spatial and Frequency Domains

Laplacian Filter In Spatial Domain Using Python

Laplacian Filter in Spatial Domain is used to enhance edges and detect fine details.  It directly operates on pixel values of the image. In the spatial domain, Laplacian filtering involves convolving the image with a Laplacian kernel. The spatial domain approach directly operates on the pixel values of the image and applies the convolution operation using techniques such as sliding window or matrix multiplication.

Laplacian image is obtained after convolving the Laplacian kernel with the input image in spatial domain.
